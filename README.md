A community deep understanding of מסכת שבת and in particular מלאכת שבת
I would like people to contribute their own understanding of each topics that are discussed in each page.
Sort of like developing code together, but instead we are developing and refining our ideas together.

The point is twofold: 
1) To deepen and sharpen each others own סברות on order so we each land up with learning skills that allow us to become פוסקים, leaders, and descision makers.
2) To lay the foundation for online learners in a deep rooted, source and סברה based way, not some artifical junk.
